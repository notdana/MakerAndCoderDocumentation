## Getting Started  

### 🟦 Block-Based Programming with McLab  
McLab is a **drag-and-drop** coding platform for MC4.0, ideal for beginners.  

1. Open **McLab** in your browser (**🔗 Link to be added**), or  
2. Download and install the **McLab Desktop version** (**🔗 Link to be added**).  
3. Load any file from the **Blocks/** folder and start coding!  

🔹 **No coding experience required** – Just drag, drop, and build!  

---

### 🟩 MicroPython with VS Code  
Use **MicroPython** for more flexible, script-based programming.  

1. Install **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**.  
2. Add the **PlatformIO** extension.  
3. Clone this repository and open the **Micropython/** folder in VS Code.  
4. Upload scripts to MC4.0 and start experimenting!

### 🟧 Arduino (C++) with Maker & Coder Board Manager  
Take full control of MC4.0 with **Arduino IDE** and **C++**.  

1. Install **[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)**.  
2. Install the **Maker & Coder Board Manager** (**🔗 Link to be added**).  
3. Open any `.ino` file from the **Arduino/** folder.  
4. Upload to MC4.0 and explore advanced functionalities!
